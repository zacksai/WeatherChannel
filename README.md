# CS 210 LAB 09: What to Wear? Calling a Weather REST API

This week we are going to create a Java program that acts as web services client, calling the public REST API hosted by the National Weather Service for retrieving forecast information.

A couple of methods for calling a simple GET web service operation and parsing the results have been provided, along with an example in the main method of making a first web service call.

Clone and verify the starter code is working for you, and then complete the following:

+ In the main() method, complete Step 3 to call the forecast service URL returned by Step 2.
+ Then complete Step 4 to display the current temperature and provide a recommendation on what clothing to wear based on the current temp.

Once you have completed and tested your program, please commit and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Ready to Grade!".
